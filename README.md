# Good ol equality table

After messing around the other day and making [`truth-table`](https://github.com/Koleok/truth-table) I just wanted something more useful and interactive, this is stage one of playing with that idea

# To run

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Koleok/react-equality-table.git
cd react-equality-table
npm i && npm start
```
